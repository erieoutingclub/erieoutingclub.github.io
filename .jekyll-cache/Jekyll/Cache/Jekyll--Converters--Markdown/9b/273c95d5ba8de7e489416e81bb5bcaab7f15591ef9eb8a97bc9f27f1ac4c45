<h2 id="erie-outing-club-hike--at-the-pennisula-at-night-time">Erie Outing Club Hike  at the Pennisula at night time.</h2>

<p>We started near the Lighthouse. It was wet in spots and we had to do some alternative trails.<br />
 The group picture is near the Maintenance Building. Ralph also join us, She is the dog.<br />
 The temperture was in the low 30â€™s with light snow. This was the first time I (webmaster) has done a Hike at night time down at the Pennisula.<br /><br /></p>
