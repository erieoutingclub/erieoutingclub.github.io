<p><strong>The Outing Club had a hike at the Pennsula on the first Sunday of 2020.
We met at the Lighthouse Parking lot and started on the side walk trail.
But over half accross we encountered a problem.The trail was flooded. So
we had through cut  throught the woods to the next availabe trail. We also notice
that beaver were cutting down trees in the area.</strong></p>
