<p>We were able to collect a small bag of litter (wanting to leave the park even better than we found it).  A few of us will return in more mild weather to pick up some other spilled cans and bottles.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>We feasted on buns filled with kielbasa and kraut, chips (thanks, Denise), vegetable pizza (thanks, Violet) peanut-butter stuffed pretzels, mandarin oranges (already peeled like that scene from the movie Titanic; thatâ€™s why the hostess calls them her â€˜Titanic orangesâ€™) , chocolate-frosted brownies, warm mulled cider (enjoyed out of china cups, of course) and chilled cider.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>We closed our meal with toasts with Sparkling Grape Juice . . . followed by some Holiday Charades.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Letâ€™s make this new year even better than the last.</p>

<p>Please make it your resolution to make a difference in 2024, Folks!</p>
