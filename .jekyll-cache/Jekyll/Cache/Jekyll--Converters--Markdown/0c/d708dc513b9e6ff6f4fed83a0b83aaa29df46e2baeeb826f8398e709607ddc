<p>Ma Nature usually obliges us with ample snow the EOCs annual SKI weekend, but the old gal dropped the ball this year. Nonetheless some 15 or so members ventured out on foot or snowshoes ( or fat bike, or skis in Will's case) to explore the park. </p>
<p><br /><br /></p>

<p> Some set out from our cushy new digs at Bova ( which it turns out really IS pronounced Bo- VAY), others hiked the Summit, some even ventured as far as Flagg Trail in the Quaker area. And while the snow wasn't quite sufficient for skiing it sure made for beautiful hiking, frosting every sapling, fern and tree in a coat of white.</p>

<p>As always the nightly campfires were inviting, food was delicious and plentiful and companionship was enjoyable. As a bonus, Dave and Yvonne shared an enjoyable slideshow of their epic, months - long tour of the UK, Egypt, Greece and Mauritius. It all made for an enjoyable weekend. Thanks to all who attended - see you on the trails!</p>
