<p>  The uniform  the day was long sleeves and panama hats. It wasn't especially hot but the
sun was strong enough to fry exposed flesh.
   In addition to Y/T, Alice, Shirley, Milt, Bob S.,,Brenxda S., Mary, Steve, Kathy, David, Janet
and Judy Y. , we enjoyed the company of new SBW Peggy..</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p> The F&amp;G access was super with a fine gravel bottom on a very gentle slope. But the parking lot sucks
with most of the lot taken up with trucks and trailers.
   The trek to the beaver dam was sorta short, prompting Shirly to mention that the paddle should
at least be as long as trip to the put-in.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The dam is still there and low enough (2ft.) to allow passage over, but that would raise the problem
of climbing over it on the return. We let the beavers alone and saved them a repair job.
   Now there's no reason to hit a rock on the lake or the swamp, but I did. Other paddlers told
the group to stay right but I was too interested in The Church of the Double Blade 
  and missed the warnings. Fugly now has a fresh divot in her bottom.
   The folks who dined apres paddle found J.Is' to be as good as any and better than most. Their
menu includs a great variety of $6 appetizers along with reasonably priced entrees.  -Rog</p>
