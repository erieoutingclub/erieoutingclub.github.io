<p>These rides offer a leisurely pace, allowing you to take in the sights and sounds of the City of Erie as you pedal along. You’ll have the opportunity to ride on country roads, gravel roads, and even the Bayfront Bike Way bike path.
<br />

<p>If you’re looking for a more structured ride, you can join a diverse group of cycling enthusiasts for a group ride on Wednesday nights from April to October. These rides are held in Edinboro, Pennsylvania and depart from the 814 Outdoor Sports parking lot at 6pm sharp. The group is divided into four groups, A, B, C, and D, to accommodate riders of all skill levels.

<p>Dating back to the days of countryside cycling, these group rides are a great way to connect with other cycling enthusiasts and explore the beautiful landscapes of Erie County. So don your helmet, hop on your bike, and join in on the fun!
