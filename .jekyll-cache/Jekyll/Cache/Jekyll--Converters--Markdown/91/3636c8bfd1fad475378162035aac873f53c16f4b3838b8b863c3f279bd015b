<p>  It was a super day for paddling on one of our favourite creeks.
12 SWBs including Bob. B., Milt, Lynne, Bob S., Brenda, Steve,
Matt, Jeanie, Annette, Y/T, Denise, and Alice took advantage of
the cooler weather to get out and play. 
   At 2.1' the water level is about as low as it gets for an enjoyable 
trek. Most of us knocked the moss off our bottoms in the shallow
sections but only one paddler took a hike. No names here, but
Alice helped with the shuttle. Daryl, a non paddler, was the driver 
of the second vehicle. Thanks Annette for sharing your hubby with
us. Milt was the point man and those who followed his line had no
trouble with rocks.The only wildlife spotted was an eagle pointed
out by Milt. 
   A lovely early dinner was enjoyed by most of us at Willie Gs' after
our splendid day, By splendid, I mean that nobody swam. -Rog</p>
