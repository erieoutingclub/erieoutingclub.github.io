  <h1> About the Erie Outing Club</h1>
<p class="dropcaps">Erie Outdoors Club, a social group
For adults who love to roam
We venture out, rain or shine
To explore and call it home

We hike and camp, and paddle too
Along the rivers and the streams
We cycle through the winding paths
And chase our dreams

In winter's cold, we ski and snowshoe
But we don't mind the frosty air
For in the great outdoors, we find
A sense of peace, beyond compare

We are a club that's non-competitive
We come together, hand in hand
To share the joys of nature's beauty
And make new friends across the land

So come and join us on our journeys
In Erie, PA, and far beyond
We'll explore the world and all it has to offer
And make memories, forever fond
