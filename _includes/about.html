  <h1> About the Erie Outing Club</h1><br>
<p class="dropcaps">
  <p>
    The Erie Outing Club is a non-competitive social outdoors club for adults (and teens accompanied with a guardian) 
    We schedule events throughout the year and enjoy hiking, backpacking, kayaking, bicycle riding, and in the wintertime snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing in the Erie region and beyond.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>Whether  you're a seasoned outdoor enthusiast or just starting out, we welcome you to join us on our activities. The Erie Outing Club is "self-propelled" -our members initiate events.
      We're a friendly and supportive group, and we love sharing our love of the outdoors with others. So come join us for outdoor adventures.</p>
