 <p>We are a social, non-competitive Outdoors Club for adults, who participate in all kinds of outdoor activities. We schedule outdoor activities throughout the year, generally in the Erie PA area and surrounding counties, including western NY and northeast Ohio.  We mostly like to go camping, hiking, backpacking, cycling, and kayaking; in the wintertime, we cross-country ski and snowshoe but are open to doing other activities also.  We enjoy socializing and will sometimes get something to eat after an event in a safe way.
