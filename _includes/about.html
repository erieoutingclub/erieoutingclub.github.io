  <h2> COVID-19 updates- Starting to get back to the new normal-Wearing Masks and keeping a 6-12 foot distance from each other</h2>
 <p>We are starting to hold club events and meetings again and doing it in a safe way. We are following CDC guidelines and wearing masks when we are within 6 to 10 feet of others during outings and  shuttles.
   We highly recommend that members that participate in events bring a mask and hand sanitizer and use it when necessary. If you don't feel healthy or think you may have a fever, please stay home. We hope you are all healthy and look forward to seeing you in the great outdoors</p>
