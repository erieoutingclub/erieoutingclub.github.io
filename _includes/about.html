  <h1> About the Erie Outing Club</h1>
<p class="dropcaps">We are a social, non-competitive Outdoors Club for adults, who participate in all kinds of outdoor activities. We schedule outdoor activities throughout the year, generally in the Erie PA area and surrounding counties, including western NY and northeast Ohio.  
  We mostly go camping, hiking, backpacking, cycling, and kayaking; in the wintertime, we cross-country ski and snowshoe but are open to doing other activities as well.</p> 
  <p>We enjoy socializing and will sometimes get something to eat after an event.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">During the Pandemic we strive to follow CDC and State guidelines to stop the spread of covid-19 (wearing a mask, physical distancing etc.)</p>
