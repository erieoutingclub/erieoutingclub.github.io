  <h1> About the Erie Outing Club</h1>
  <!--  <p>We are a Social non-competitive Outdoors Club. We go camping, hiking, backpacking, cycling,kayaking. We also get together and eat together. We love socializing and talking about our favorite outdoor activities. We will go camping for the weekend and go backpacking , cycling or kayaking. In the winter time we go cross-country skiing and snowshoeing</p> -->
  <h2> COVID-19 updates</h2>
 <p>I would just like to say with regards to the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in reference the coronavirus, it probably is wise for our club not to organize any official group activities for the present time.  A member brought this sentiment to my attention that we as a club should not be encouraging any group activities especially as we are mostly older people. ​
It is probably wise to distance ourselves as much as we can and keep safe.  ​
Hopefully very soon the situation will have greatly improved and we can begin to enjoy scheduled events that will be on the calendar.  Again Be safe everyone and I look forward to seeing you all later in the year.</p>
