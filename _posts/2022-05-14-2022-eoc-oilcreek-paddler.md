 <p>Another great paddle!<p/><br>

<p>Six members of the EOC experienced a wonderful paddle on Oil Creek Saturday.<p/><br>

      <p>There was (L. to R.) Lee N., Roger R., Alice D., Roger’s daughter Julie, Janet Y., and John M.</p><br>

<p>The depth was decent, the weather was perfect, the company and conversation was stellar,  the scenery exquisite,  and the wildlife comforting; we spied several paddlings of ducks and lots of geese (both in gaggles and in skeins and even a brood of goslings.</p><br>

 

<p>The biggest laugh of the day was when Roger just sat there at lunch shaking his head and lamenting, “Darn, what a bummer day. I could be home curled up reading a book.”   NOT!</P><br>

 

<p>It was great paddling with all of you – thanks for the fun day.</p>
