<p>I took a ride over to Bridger Park near the Millcreek Mall. The park is located on Zimmery Road off Peach Street. If you going south on
Peach Street turn right or west at the Rite Aid on to Zimmerly. It is Located on Old Zimmerly Road and West St. in Millcreek Township along the bank of Walnut Creek next to the Sewer overflow facility.</p>
<p><a href="https://erietrails.org/bridger-park/" target="_blank">Bridger Park on Erie Trail Web site</a></p>
<p>The parking lot is small, about 3 or 4 cars max, but there is a bigger parking lot next to the Sewer overflow facility.</p> 
<p>There are two trails. One goes
west which is an up and back trail which is tar and chip. The other is a loop trail which is mostly wood chips.</p> 
<p>The trails are very short but would be nice for older folks who don't walk much. Or maybe you just want to go for a short hike after dinner at a restaurant on Peach Street.</p>
<p>The trail has a great view of Walnut Creek. The creek might be nice for fishing. On the other side of the creek, you can see the Millcreek Mall from the trail.</p>
