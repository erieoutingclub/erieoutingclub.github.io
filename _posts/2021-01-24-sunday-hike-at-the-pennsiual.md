Nine members of the Erie Outing club decided to hike at Presque Isle on Sunday afternoon and the weather was chilly but not too windy. We were able to walk down the beach and enjoy the scenery. There has been a lot of storm damage out there this year. Down by the maintenance road there were obviously waves and wind recently and there was ice on the upright and fallen trees. It made for some nice pictures. We had a fire afterwards and some hot chocolate and snacks provided by the members.
