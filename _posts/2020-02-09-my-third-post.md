## Erie Outing Club Hike  at the Pennisula at night time.

  We started near the Lighthouse. It was wet in spots and we had to do some alternative trails.<br>
 The group picture is near the Maintenance Building. Ralph also join us, She is the dog.<br>
 The temperture was in the low 30's with light snow. This was the first time I (webmaster) has done a Hike at night time down at the Pennisula.<br><br>
