<p> We rented some cabins on the Beehunter Loop at Allegany State Park and we kayaked, biked and hiked.  Some came and just joined the hike on Saturday.  We had a campfire every night.  The usual routine when a bunch of us get together- small groups doing different things.  It rained Saturday for most of the morning and some people went to see some nearby attractions and museums.<br><br>  Wendy O</p><br><br>
<p>Our annual ASP Fall outing was a tale of two seasons. Thursday and Friday were warm and summery. Saturday and Sunday were cool, drizzly and occasionally rainy. But our group was unfazed and enjoyed hiking, biking, paddling, campfiring and lots of eating.<br><br>John S</p>
