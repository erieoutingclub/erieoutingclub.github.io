# Chautauqua Gorge Hike<br><br>

## Erie Outing Club Hike  at the Pennisula at night time.

  Dave and Yvonne led a fabulous hike down the Gorge yesterday. Five ample breaks were taken, two of which involved swimming! So the overall time in the Gorge was seven hours not the usual six! Luckily we stepped into the Gorge at 9am and we saw no one else on the trail (creek). What a totally gorgeous summer day to be immersed in Nature:) We had to be nimble on our feet: so many rock gardens to traverse and the going, when creek crossing, was sometimes slippy (and sometimes not!). But Dave, Yvonne, John S, YT, Pam, Nancy, Shelly and Tammy survived unscathed! Yea! And the creek and the gorge lived up to its reputation of untold beauty
