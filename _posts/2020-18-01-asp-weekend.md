<p>Another Annual Erie Outing Club ASP Winter Weekend is in the books. Mother Nature cooperated nicely with daytime temps in the 30's and nights in the 20's with fresh snow each day. Any down-time between skiing, snowshoeing, hiking or campfiring was spent eating as usual. Thank you to everyone for making it a successful event and a lot of fun.</p>
