 A very pleasant masked hike was had along Elk Creek, from Waterworks Park in Girard. 12 members and friends of the Erie Outing Club headed out promptly at 1.30pm on Sunday afternoon, December 6, 2020. By flying down the hill Denise luckily caught the tail end of the column as we disappeared into the woods.

The day was overcast, 30 degrees and no wind. I think we were all comfortably dressed for the conditions:) 

The (mostly) single track trail along the creek began in perfect condition with amazingly no snow or ice. But pretty soon it degenerated to puddles and mud! It was a good thing most of us sported hiking poles! 

Many of the group had not hiked the trail before so were pleasantly surprised by it's scenic appeal. On our return, a train passed overhead on the trestle bridge! 

And when we arrived at the starting/ finishing point Wendy had hot chocolate awaiting us! Mary Beth had cheese and crackers and Violet brought donuts! What better way to complete a Seasonal Outing Club Hike:) Happy holidays everyone:)

It was lovely to see old friends and new! Thanks to all who came out.
