<p>It was a warm sunny winter day, fairly mild for February during the Presidents day weekend. We took a hike from the George Washington Statue in Waterford, Pa to the Covered Bridge. The distance wasn't too bad only about 4 miles mostly on country roads.</p><br>

 <p>The George Washington Statue  was first placed in 1922 upon the site of the original Fort LeBoeuf, which was in the middle of High Street between the Eagle Hotel and the historic Judson House. The monument was moved in 1945 to the lot beside the Eagle Hotel. What makes this monument unique? This is the only statue of Washington wearing a British uniform in Pennsylvania.</p><br>
 
 <p>We walked on some city streets toward the St. Peter’s Episcopal Church. St. Peter’s Episcopal Church has endured for over 180 years as a bold Christian symbol in this northwestern Pennsylvania.</p><br>
  <p>We then stopped at the Waterford Cemetery to view the  Micheal Hare Memorial. He lived to be 115 years old and served in the French and Indian war Memorial.
  We then walked on country roads toward the Covered Bridge.</p>
  
  <p>The Cover Bridge was close to traffic, but you could walk through it. Covered Bridge (1875): 86-ft. wood lattice truss bridge built by brothers Charles and James Phelps.</p><br>
